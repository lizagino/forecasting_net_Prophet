Forecasting Net Prophet
Welcome to the Forecasting Net Prophet project! As a growth analyst at MercadoLibre, the leading e-commerce platform in Latin America, your mission is to analyze financial and user data creatively to drive the company's growth. This project explores the possibility of predicting search traffic and its impact on stock trading success.

Instructions
This challenge is divided into four main steps and an optional fifth step:

Step 1: Find Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic
Explore Google search traffic data for unusual patterns and their correlation with corporate financial events, especially during May 2020, when MercadoLibre released its quarterly financial results.

Step 2: Mine the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality
Discover predictable seasonal patterns in the hourly search traffic data that can guide marketing efforts to maximize ROI.

Step 3: Relate the Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns
Investigate the relationship between search data and stock prices, particularly during the first half of 2020, when global financial markets faced challenges.

Step 4: Create a Time Series Model with Prophet
Build a time series model using Prophet to analyze and forecast hourly search data patterns.

Step 5 (Optional): Forecast Revenue by Using Time Series Models
If you choose to proceed with this optional step, you'll forecast the total sales for the next quarter, providing valuable insights for financial planning and investor expectations.

Each step is detailed in the following subsections.

Step 1: Find Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic
Analyze Google search traffic data for the company during May 2020.
Visualize the data using hvPlot to identify unusual patterns.
Compare May's total search traffic to the monthly median to understand any significant changes.
Step 2: Mine the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality
Group hourly search data by the day of the week to discover day-specific traffic patterns.
Create a heatmap using hvPlot to visualize hourly and day-of-week effects.
Group search data by the week of the year and investigate seasonal changes.
Step 3: Relate the Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns
Combine and visualize stock price data along with search data.
Analyze both time series for common trends in the first half of 2020.
Create lagged search trends, stock volatility, and hourly stock return columns.
Assess correlations to determine relationships between search traffic and stock factors.
Step 4: Create a Time Series Model with Prophet
Prepare the search data for a Prophet forecasting model.
Estimate and plot the Prophet forecast for near-term search traffic.
Explore individual time series components to understand popularity peaks and lows.
Step 5 (Optional): Forecast Revenue by Using Time Series Models
Import historical daily sales (revenue) data and apply a Prophet model.
Interpret the model's output to identify revenue seasonality.
Provide a sales forecast for the next quarter, including best- and worst-case scenarios for financial planning.
These steps will guide you through the analysis and forecasting processes, helping you extract valuable insights from the data.

Happy forecasting!
